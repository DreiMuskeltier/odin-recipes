TOP html project

In this project I will create a html site (using the resources previously introduced).
Git and GitHub are a bit shaky, I hope I'll get more confident. Whenever possible I try to use the terminal.
Creating the html itself should be okay.

Reflection during the project:
- getting down the basics with git, I get by without looking at my notes
- getting down the basics with html
- learned that the anchor can wrap around images (so that the image itself serves as a link)
- need to pay attention to small details (like not forgetting the file extensions)
- I am aware of the footer element, where the disclaimers of my recipe pages could go but didn't use it in this project

Reflection after project submission:
- this project made me feel more confident using git and GitHub
- I also am more comfortable to use the terminal for basic functions (creating, deleting and moving files around)
- I get how the html elements introduced up to this point. Although VS Code automatically closes the tags as soon as I make them. If using other tools I need to be aware of it
- It took a surprising amount of time, even though I copied the layouts for the recipes instead of recreating them from scratch every single time
